# Python & Machine Learning -SpringSchool2021

In this repository you can find notebooks of the Python & Machine Learning -SpringSchool2021. The video of every session and other regarding files are available in google drive and available from the [Scientific Association of Physics Students, Shahid Beheshti University](http://sbuphysics.com/). You can call them to attain the files. 

This school includes three workshops : 1-Introduction to python tools for implementing
data, 2-Introduction to Machine Learning theories, 3-Hands on projects

In these workshops, firstly, I have started by introducing python tools for manipulating data.
Then I lectured about Machine Learning and using libraries to complete an ML project. At last,
the participants would be supervised to do their final projects in the school.
